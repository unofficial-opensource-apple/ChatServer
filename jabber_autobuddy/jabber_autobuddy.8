.Sh DESCRIPTION
jabber_autobuddy is not intended to be invoked by users directly.  It is a utility for managing buddies/contacts for jabberd by directly modifying the service's SQLite database tables.  The primary use of the tool is to make all jabber users a "buddy" of every other jabber user, which is not ideal for a system with a large number of users.  See the list of commands for a description of each supported operation.  The JID specified in the commands is of format <username>@<hostname>.  Logging goes to syslog.
