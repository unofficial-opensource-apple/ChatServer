        * Released version 0.5.1.

2002-09-09  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * setup.cfg: Fixed build requirements for rpms.

2002-09-07  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * src/ssl/connection.c: Fix sendall() method. It segfaulted because
          it was too generous about giving away the GIL.
        * Added SecureXMLRPCServer example, contributed by Michal Wallace.

2002-09-06  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * setup.cfg: Updated the build requirements.
        * src/ssl/connection.c: Fix includes for AIX.

2002-09-04  Anders Hammarquist  <iko@strakt.com>

	* Added type checks in all the other places where we expect
	  specific types of objects passed.

2002-09-04  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * src/crypto/crypto.c: Added an explicit type check in the dump_*
          functions, so that they won't die when e.g. None is passed in.

2002-08-25  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * doc/pyOpenSSL.tex: Docs for PKCS12.

2002-08-24  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * src/crypto: Added basic PKCS12 support, thanks to Mark Welch
          <mark@collab.net>

2002-08-16  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * D'oh! Fixes for python 1.5 and python 2.1.

2002-08-15  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * Version 0.5. Yay!

2002-07-25  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * src/ssl/context.c: Added set_options method.
        * src/ssl/ssl.c: Added constants for Context.set_options method.

2002-07-23  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * Updated docs
        * src/ssl/connection.c: Changed the get_cipher_list method to actually
          return a list! WARNING: This change makes the API incompatible with
          earlier versions!

2002-07-15  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * src/ssl/connection.[ch]: Removed the fileno method, it uses the
          transport object's fileno instead.

2002-07-09  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * src/crypto/x509.c src/crypto/x509name.c: Fixed segfault bug where
          you used an X509Name after its X509 had been destroyed.
        * src/crypto/crypto.[ch] src/crypto/x509req.c src/crypto/x509ext.[ch]:
          Added X509 Extension support. Thanks to maas-Maarten Zeeman
          <maas@awanim.com>
        * src/crypto/pkey.c: Added bits() and type() methods.

2002-07-08  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * src/ssl/connection.c: Moved the contents of setup_ssl into the
          constructor, thereby fixing some segfault bugs :)
        * src/ssl/connection.c: Added connect_ex and sendall methods.
        * src/crypto/x509name.c: Cleaned up comparisons and NID lookup.
          Thank you Maas-Maarten Zeeman <maas@awanim.com>
        * src/rand/rand.c: Fix RAND_screen import.
        * src/crypto/crypto.c src/crypto/pkcs7.[ch]: Added PKCS7 management,
          courtesy of Maas-Maarten Zeeman <maas@awanim.com>
        * src/crypto/x509req.c: Added verify method.

2002-06-17  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * rpm/, setup.cfg: Added improved RPM-building stuff, thanks to
          Mihai Ibanescu <misa@redhat.com>

2002-06-14  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * examples/proxy.py: Example code for using OpenSSL through a proxy
          contributed by Mihai Ibanescu <misa@redhat.com>
        * Updated installation instruction and added them to the TeX manual.

2002-06-13  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * src/ssl/context.c: Changed global_verify_callback so that it uses
          PyObject_IsTrue instead of requring ints.
        * Added pymemcompat.h to make the memory management uniform and
          backwards-compatible.
        * src/util.h: Added conditional definition of PyModule_AddObject and
          PyModule_AddIntConstant
        * src/ssl/connection.c: Socket methods are no longer explicitly
          wrapped. fileno() is the only method the transport layer object HAS
          to support, but if you want to use connect, accept or sock_shutdown,
          then the transport layer object has to supply connect, accept
          and shutdown respectively.

2002-06-12  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * Changed comments to docstrings that are visible in Python.
        * src/ssl/connection.c: Added set_connect_state and set_accept_state
          methods. Thanks to Mark Welch <mark@collab.net> for this.

2002-06-11  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * src/ssl/connection.c: accept and connect now use SSL_set_accept_state
          and SSL_set_connect_state respectively, instead of SSL_accept and
          SSL_connect.
        * src/ssl/connection.c: Added want_read and want_write methods.

2002-06-05  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * src/ssl/connection.c: Added error messages for windows. The code is
          copied from Python's socketmodule.c. Ick.
        * src/ssl/connection.c: Changed the parameters to the SysCallError. It
          always has a tuple (number, string) now, even though the number
          might not always be useful.

2002-04-05  Martin Sjögren  <md9ms@mdstud.chalmers.se>

        * Worked more on the Debian packaging, hopefully the packages
          are getting into the main Debian archive soon.

2002-01-10  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * Worked some more on the Debian packaging, it's turning out real
          nice.
        * Changed format on this file, I'm going to try to be a bit more
          verbose about my changes, and this format makes it easier.

2002-01-08  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * Version 0.4.1
        * Added some example code
        * Added the thread safe Connection object in the 'tsafe' submodule
        * New Debian packaging

2001-08-09  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * Version 0.4
        * Added a compare function for X509Name structures.
        * Moved the submodules to separate .so files, with tiny C APIs so they
          can communicate
        * Skeletal OpenSSL/__init__.py
        * Removed the err submodule, use crypto.Error and SSL.Error instead

2001-08-06  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * Version 0.3
        * Added more types for dealing with certificates (X509Store, X509Req,
          PKey)
        * Functionality to load private keys, certificates and certificate
          requests from memory buffers, and store them too
        * X509 and X509Name objects can now be modified as well, very neat when
          creating certificates ;)
        * Added SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY to smooth things for blocking sockets
        * Added a sock_shutdown() method to the Connection type
        * I don't understand why, but I can't use Py_InitModule() to create
          submodules in Python 2.0, the interpreter segfaults on the cleanup
          process when I do. I added a conditional compile on the version
          number, falling back to my own routine. It would of course be nice to
          investigate what is happening, but I don't have the time to do so
        * Do INCREF on the type objects before inserting them in the
          dictionary, so they will never reach refcount 0 (they are, after all,
          statically allocated)

2001-07-30  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * Version 0.2
        * Lots of tweaking and comments in the code
        * Now uses distutils instead of the stupid Setup file
        * Hacked doc/tools/mkhowto, html generation should now work

2001-07-16  Martin Sjögren  <martin@strakt.com>

        * Initial release (0.1, don't expect much from this one :-)
