The main culprits for this release are:

  Ryan Eatmon       <reatmon@jabber.org>
    - Much of the early work on jadc2s, which fed into the design of SX
      and the components. Also the startup script, and some excellent
      design work which helped to set the long term goals for the
      project (router meshing, distributed components, etc).

  Jeremie Miller    <jeremie@jabber.org>
    - Getting the project off the ground in the first place. MIO, much
      of the SM core (formerly jadlsm), most of the utilties (which came
      from the 1.4 server), and of course the NAD subsystem, which is
      the boon and the bane of a j2 developers' life ;)

  Thomas Muldowney  <temas@jabber.org>
    - The original Autotools-based build system, some early jadc2s work
      (rate limiting), utilities, and lots of good testing and debugging
      advice.

  Robert Norris     <rob@cataclysm.cx>
    - Overall system design, pretty much all the other code, and the
      current coordinator for this whole mess.

  Stephen Marquard  <xmpp:scm@jabber.org>
    - Uber bug fixer and the main dev keeping this project alive

Thanks also go to the testers and bug reporters out there - you know who
you are. Special thanks in this capacity to Justin Kirby, whose many
failed efforts to compile j2 helped get much of the build system to
where it is today.

If you're have questions or problems, please check the README file for
places you can go for help. Expect to be ignored if you contact the
authors directly.
