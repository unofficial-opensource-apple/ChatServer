Protocol support
----------------

jabberd 2.0 is a server implementation of the eXtensible Messaging and
Presence Protocol (XMPP), as published by the IETF. It also implements
several XMPP extensions documented by the Jabber Software Foundation
(JSF), and some legacy extensions that were implemented by its
predecessor, jabberd 1.4.

This document lists the protocols supported by the server, and any notes
relating to the implementation.

This is current as of 2005-04-04 (jabberd 2.0s9).


XMPP
----

XMPP Core (RFC 3920)

 Implemented, except for:
  - SASL for s2s streams
  - Language support via xml:lang

XMPP IM (RFC 3921)

 Implemented.


JSF Extensions
--------------

Jabber Browsing (JEP-0011)

 Implemented by the session manager (mod_disco) as a wrapper around the
 service list used for Service Discovery. The configuration required to
 enable browsing is undocumented as browse is considered to be
 deprecated.

Last Activity (JEP-0012)

 Implemented by the session manager (mod_iq_last).

Message Events (JEP-0022)

 Offline event implemented by the session manager (mod_offline).

Message Expiration (JEP-0023)

 Implemented by the session manager (mod_offline).

Service Discovery (JEP-0030)

 Implemented by the session manager (mod_disco). Administrative users
 will see extra nodes when doing a #items query - these nodes provide
 information about active users and sessions. New components becoming
 available are probed automatically, and if they are disco-aware, their
 information is added to the service list. Sub-entity item publishing is
 implemented seperately by mod_disco_publish.

Private XML Storage (JEP-0049)

 Implemented by the session manager (mod_iq_private).

vcard-temp (JEP-0054)

 Implemented by the session manager (mod_iq_vcard).

In-band Registration (JEP-0077)

 Implemented by c2s.

Non-SASL Authentication (JEP-0078)

 Implemented by c2s.

Legacy Errors (JEP-0086)

 Implemented.

Entity Time (JEP-0090)

 Implemented by the session manager (mod_iq_time).

Delayed Delivery (JEP-0091)

 Implemented by the session manager.

Software Version (JEP-0092)

 Implemented by the session manager (mod_iq_version).

Agent Information (JEP-0094)

 Implemented by the session manager (mod_disco) as a wrapper around the
 service list used for Service Discovery.

External Component Protocol (JEP-0114)

 Implemented by the router as a wrapper around the more featureful
 jabberd 2.0 component protocol.


Legacy extensions (jabberd 1.4)
-------------------------------

Invisible presence

 Implemented by the session manager. Note that the JSF version of this
 as documented in JEP-0018 is substantially different to the traditional
 implementation.
